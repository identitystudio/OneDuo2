# UI Simplification Plan
## Based on Beta User Feedback (Darcey Session)

### Core Problem
The UI is too wordy and confusing. Users don't understand what they're getting or how things work.

## ✅ Completed Changes

### Landing Page
- [x] Hero reduced to 2 lines: "Upload a video. Get an execution guide."
- [x] "How it works" reduced from 4 steps to 3
- [x] Removed verbose sections (Before/After, Objection Killers, Authority Quote)
- [x] Replaced detailed use cases with simple chips

### Auth Page
- [x] Removed Shield icon and benefit boxes
- [x] Cleaner, minimal sign-in flow

### Upload Page
- [x] Submit button now shows total file count (videos + docs)
- [x] PDF toggle has descriptive sub-labels explaining Combined vs Separate

## 🔲 Remaining Simplifications

### Dashboard
- [ ] Remove confusion about what "Add Files" does vs "Add Module"
- [ ] Clearer progress states (what's happening NOW)
- [ ] Simpler download experience - one clear button
- [ ] Remove or simplify module navigation for single-video uploads

### Upload Flow
- [ ] Remove density mode dropdown (confuse users)
- [ ] Simplify to: "Upload → Wait → Download"
- [ ] Consider removing FPS target (advanced, confusing)

### Copy Throughout
- [ ] Replace jargon: "artifact" → "guide" or "playbook"
- [ ] Replace "module" → "video" for single uploads
- [ ] Replace "transform" → "process" or "create"

### Navigation
- [ ] Remove or hide advanced menu items (Transform Engine, Patent Archive)
- [ ] Simplify header to: Logo | My Guides | Sign In

### Processing Status
- [ ] Replace technical steps with human-friendly labels:
  - "Extracting frames" → "Watching your video"
  - "Analyzing audio" → "Listening for key moments"
  - "Generating PDF" → "Creating your guide"

## Design Principles (from feedback)

1. **Less words, more clarity** - Every word must earn its place
2. **Show, don't explain** - The interface should be self-evident
3. **One path forward** - Don't overwhelm with options
4. **Execution reality** - Focus on "what do I DO next"

---

## Priority Order

1. Dashboard simplification (where users spend most time)
2. Processing status clarity (reduces support questions)
3. Copy cleanup (systematic jargon removal)
4. Navigation simplification
