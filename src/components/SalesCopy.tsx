      {/* Opening */}
      <p className="mb-6">
        <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span><span className="text-white">: AI's Thinking Layer.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">This isn't another AI.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">It's what makes AI finally understand your work.</p>

      {/* The Problem */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">Your VA using AI without <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> is like handing her a Ferrari with no road.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6">She's stuck.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Not because she's incompetent. Because AI can watch videos but can't understand work.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">When she asks: <span className="italic">"Where do I start building the voice bot?"</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">And you've already recorded a 10-minute Loom showing exactly how to do it...</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6">The problem isn't that she didn't watch.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">The problem is the AI helping her can't compress what you showed into <span className="text-[#c4f547]">executable memory</span>.</p>

      {/* The Workaround */}
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">So she tries the workaround. She uploads the transcript to ChatGPT and asks: <span className="italic">"Where do I start?"</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">ChatGPT says: <span className="text-white/50 italic">"Got it. I understand how this training works."</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">That's not helpful.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Or she uploads the video to Gemini and asks for a summary to give to Claude...</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6">But the summary loses the context.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/50 mb-6">Which step mattered vs. which didn't. What sequence can't be reordered. Why you emphasized that one click. What happens if she skips the setup phase.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">The AI watched. The AI summarized. But it didn't understand work.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6">So she comes back to you. Again. At 11 PM. With the same question you've already answered.</p>

      {/* The Difference */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">There's a difference between AI that watches and AI that <span className="text-[#c4f547]">understands work</span>.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6"><span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> doesn't help AI watch videos. It helps AI understand work.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">So your VA can finally execute — without you being the permanent answer machine she Slacks at midnight.</p>

      {/* What's Happening */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">So what's actually happening?</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Your VA is trying to execute. She's watching the training. She's reading the transcripts. She's uploading to ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6">She's doing everything right.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">But she's stuck in a broken loop.</p>

      {/* The Loop */}
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Step 1: She uploads the transcript to ChatGPT → ChatGPT sees words, not work → Generic response: "Got it, I understand"</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Step 2: She tries Gemini instead → Uploads the video for a better summary → The summary captures what happened, but not why it happened</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Step 3: She pastes that summary into Claude → But now it's a summary of a summary → The context degrades with each transfer</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Step 4: She tries to execute anyway → Gets stuck → Slacks you: "Quick question..."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-12">And you're right back where you started.</p>

      {/* Infrastructure */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">The <span className="text-[#c4f547]">infrastructure</span> is broken.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Not the VA. Not the training. Not the AI models.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">The translation layer between human instruction and machine execution doesn't exist.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-12">Until now.</p>

      {/* What OneDuo Does */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">What <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> actually does.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6"><span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> is the missing compression layer.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">It takes your training video and compresses it into executable memory. The same way a competent human delegate would internalize training.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Not a transcript. Not a summary. Not "I understand."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">An artifact that preserves: which action changed the outcome, which click mattered, what sequence must not be reordered, what you emphasized as critical, where a human would pause and say "this part matters."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">That artifact is portable. You can paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, or whatever AI comes next.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">And the AI can actually answer your VA's questions.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Instead of: <span className="text-white/50 italic">"Got it. I understand how this training works."</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">The AI responds: <span className="text-white/80">"Start with the intent, not the tool. At 12:47, she explains why the voice bot comes before automations — it handles objections before routing. Go to your dashboard. Click the arrow next to Projects (top right). Select Voice Trainer. This matters because the prompts you write here determine how the bot handles pricing resistance later. Tell me when you're there."</span></p>

      {/* See The Difference */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">See the difference?</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">ChatGPT with transcript: "I understand."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">ChatGPT with <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span>: "Here's what matters, why it matters, what order, and what happens if you skip it."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">That's not watching. That's not summarizing. That's understanding work.</p>

      {/* VA Can Execute */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">Your VA can finally <span className="text-[#c4f547]">execute</span>.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Because now when she asks ChatGPT: <span className="italic">"Which step comes first?"</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">The AI doesn't guess. It knows.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Because you compressed your expertise into an artifact the AI can actually work with.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">Your VA gets unstuck. She executes without you. You stop being the bottleneck.</p>

      {/* Why OneDuo Exists */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">This is why <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> exists.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Not because AI can't see video. Because AI can't compress video into executable memory the way humans do.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">That's the missing layer between your expertise trapped in Looms and courses... and your team actually executing without you.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-12"><span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> is that layer.</p>

      {/* Alternatives */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">But wait — couldn't I just...?</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">You're probably thinking: "Can't I just use [alternative]?"</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">Let's address that. Because every operator asks this question. And the answer reveals why <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> is infrastructure, not just another tool.</p>

      {/* Alternative 1 */}
      <p className="text-white mb-6">"Can't I just train my VA better?"</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">You already tried that. You recorded the Loom. You bought the $997 course. You walked her through it on Zoom.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">The training isn't the problem.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">The problem is the AI helping her execute can't understand the training the way a human delegate would. Better training doesn't fix a broken translation layer.</p>

      {/* Alternative 2 */}
      <p className="text-white mb-6">"Can't I just use Gemini? It can watch videos now."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Yes, Gemini can watch videos. But watching ≠ understanding work.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6"><span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> compresses the video into the artifact Gemini needs to actually answer the question. Gemini provides the intelligence. <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> provides the institutional memory.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">They're complementary, not competitive.</p>

      {/* Alternative 3 */}
      <p className="text-white mb-6">"Can't I just prompt Gemini better?"</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">You could try. Upload your video. Craft the "perfect prompt." Get back a detailed summary. Paste it into Claude. Give it to your VA. She tries to execute. She gets stuck.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Because Gemini's summary captured WHAT happened in the video. But not the emphasis you put on "this part matters." Not the context of WHY. Not the distinction between critical path vs. nice-to-have.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">The problem isn't your prompting skills. The problem is Gemini is optimized for summarization, not work compression.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">Those are different tasks. Gemini does the first one well. <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> does the second one.</p>

      {/* The Difference Illustrated */}
      <p className="text-white mb-6">Gemini's summary says: <span className="text-white/50 italic">"The instructor explains how to build a voice bot. First, access the dashboard. Then configure the settings. Finally, test the bot."</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">That's accurate. But it's not executable.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6"><span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span>'s compressed memory says: <span className="text-white/80">"Start with the intent, not the tool. At 12:47, she explains why the voice bot comes before automations — it handles objections before routing. This matters because the prompts you write here determine how the bot handles pricing resistance later."</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">One tells you WHAT. One gives you WHY, WHEN, WHERE, and WHAT HAPPENS IF. You can't prompt your way to the second one.</p>

      {/* What Becomes Possible */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">What becomes possible.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">When your VA can finally execute without you... Everything changes. Not just "you save time." Your entire business architecture transforms.</p>

      {/* You Stop Being The Bottleneck */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">You stop being the <span className="text-[#c4f547]">bottleneck</span>.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Right now, every critical task flows through you. Not because you're the only one who CAN do it. Because you're the only one who knows how to translate the training into execution.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">You attend the 3-day event. You buy the $3K course. You give your VA the login and say: "Watch this, use ChatGPT to figure it out, and execute."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">But she can't. Because the expert spent 90 minutes explaining the philosophy. And your VA needs to know which 8 minutes actually matter for implementation.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">She uploads the transcript to ChatGPT. ChatGPT says: "Got it. I understand the training." But when she asks where to start, ChatGPT gives her generic steps that miss the expert's specific methodology.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6">So she comes back to you. Because you're the only one who attended the event AND knows how to extract executable steps from 3 days of training.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">You become the translation layer. The bottleneck.</p>

      {/* With OneDuo */}
      <p className="text-white mb-6">With <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span>:</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">You drop the event recording links into <span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span>. It compresses 3 days of training into executable memory. You give your VA the artifact. She pastes it into ChatGPT and asks: <span className="italic">"Where do I start building the voice bot?"</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">ChatGPT responds with the compressed memory: <span className="text-white/80">"Start with the intent framework from Day 2, Session 3 at 1:14:32. The expert emphasized: voice bots come BEFORE automations because they handle objections before routing."</span></p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6">She executes. Without you.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">Suddenly, the $3K event you attended doesn't require YOU to be the permanent translator. Your investment in training can finally multiply across your team. You can delegate leverage, not just tasks.</p>

      {/* Two Paths */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">So here's what happens next.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">You have two paths forward.</p>

      {/* Path 1 */}
      <p className="text-white mb-6">Path 1: Keep doing what you're doing.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">You attend the next event. Buy the next course. Send your VA the login. Tell her: "Use AI to figure it out."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">She uploads the transcript to the smartest AI available. The AI watches. The AI summarizes. The AI says: "Got it. I understand this training."</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">But when she asks where to start, the AI — no matter how advanced — gives her generic steps. Because smarter AI doesn't solve the structural problem.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">So she gets stuck. Slacks you at 11 PM. You explain it. Again.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">You stay the bottleneck. The person who can't take a vacation because "nobody else knows how to do this."</p>

      {/* Path 2 */}
      <p className="text-white mb-6">Path 2: Build the <span className="text-[#c4f547]">infrastructure</span>.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">You stop trying to solve an infrastructure problem with better AI models. And start building the layer that makes ANY AI actually useful for your business.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">You compress your investments. That $3K event you just attended? Compress it. That $997 course on voice bots? Compress it. That client delivery process you've perfected? Compress it.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Compress it once. Let your team execute it forever.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Your business stops depending on you being the translation layer. And starts running on institutional memory that works with ANY AI.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-12"><span className="text-[#c4f547]">OneDuo</span> is that layer.</p>

      {/* Getting Started */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">OK, how do I get started?</p>

      <p className="text-white/60 mb-6">Your VA gets an email. Downloads the artifact. Pastes it into ChatGPT. Asks: "Where do I start?" The AI responds with compressed executable memory.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white mb-6">She executes. Without Slacking you.</p>
      
      <p className="text-white/60 mb-12">You're at your kid's soccer game. Or finishing that workout. Or closing that deal. And when you check in later? It's done. Correctly. Without you being in the loop.</p>

      {/* 5 Minutes */}
      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-6">You're 5 minutes away from this.</p>
